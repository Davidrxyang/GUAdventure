move all quit processes and memory deallocation into main close window method in window class
    - quit all SDL systems we opened in Window::initialize
    - deallocate all arrays
    - deallocate all TEXTURES
    - deallocate all SDL files that stored data - media, audio, etc
    - deallocate dynamically allocated memory - PARTICLE ENGINE

set global constants
    - consider setting constants in a global file?

implement all rendering as part of a texture class?
    - this will take a shit ton of time, but it may be worth it if we are implementing scrolling windows
    - passing a window object every single time through to the texture class in order to access renderer?
